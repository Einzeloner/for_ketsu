# Extra after installing the base system


You can use the arrow keys to navigate



Okay so after you've run the script and now have some more basic packages installed, I wanted to let you know
about some things.

You will need an AUR helper like yay or trizen, I'd personally recommend yay.

After you've installed yay, You can run this command for some packages that I'd like you to have because
they are dependent on my Awesome( Window manager) rice. Although I will also make the script download dwm because why not.

#Instructions to install yay

                        ********* git must be installed *********

Paste these into the terminal after you have started the GUI (we'll get to it later)

1>  cd /opt
2> sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
3> sudo chown -R  yourusernamehere ./yay-git
4> cd yay-git
5> makepkg -si

That's it, you've installed yay. Pat yourself on the back.

#Now run this command

yay -S i3lock-fancy-git light-git liketaskmanager-git teams



What do they do?

i3lock-fancy-git = This is my screen locker

Light-git = Used for controlling the brightness from the top bar, just scroll on the widget for changing brightness

liketaskmanager-git = It's a windows like task manager just to keep in case the terminal becomes confusing

teams = Microsoft teams



                            *********** Installing DWM **************
                            
                            
Now you are ready to install DWM (The dynamic window manager)

1> cd to the folder where the tar file of dwm was extracted.
    i.e - `cd ~/for_ketsu/dwm-6.2`

2> You need to install dwm from the sources, which means compiling and editing the source code
    i.e - `sudo make install`

3> DWM uses ST as it's default terminal. You need to download that too which is already done by the script.

4> Go to the ST folder.
    i.e - `cd ~/for_ketsu/st-0.8.4`

5> Same goes with ST as with DWM. You need to compile from the source
    i.e - `sudo make install`
    
 Done!
 Now you have installed everything that I wanted you to. These are just steps that you can comeback to at anytime. After you are done with the graphical session, open up a terminal and try these.
 
 
 
 
Now you've installed all the required packages.

The only thing that remians is to start the GUI or Graphical session

#type this into the terminal

startx





you can find this file in your home folder in the for_ketsu folder with the name extra.txt. Then just open the extra.txt to get back to
it anytime.

And now to exit this file you just press q
