# Extra after installing the base system


You can use the arrow keys to navigate UwU



Okay so after you've run the script and now have some more basic packages installed, I wanted to let you know
about some things.

You will need an Aur helper like yay or trizen, I'd personally recommend yay.

After you've installed yay, You can run this command for some packages that I'd like you to have because
they are dependent on my Awesome( Window manager) rice.

#Instructions to install yay

""""git must be installed""""

Paste these into the terminal after you have started the GUI (we'll get to it later)

1>  cd /opt
2> sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
3> sudo chown -R  yourusernamehere ./yay-git
4> cd yay-git
5> makepkg -si

That's it, you've installed yay. Pat yourself on the back.

#Now run this command

yay -S i3lock-fancy-git light-git liketaskmanager-git teams



What do they do?

i3lock-fancy-git = This is my screen locker

Light-git = Used for controlling the brightness from the top bar, just scroll on the widget for changing brightness

liketaskmanager-git = It's a windows like task manager just to keep in case the terminal becomes confusing

teams = Microsoft teams


Now you've installed all the required packages.

The only thing that remians is to start the GUI or Graphical session

#type this into the terminal

startx





you can find this file in your home folder with the name for_ketsu. Then just open the extra.txt to get back to
it anytime.

And now to exit this file you just press q
